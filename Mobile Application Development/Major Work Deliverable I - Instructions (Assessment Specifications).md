# Major Work Design Assessment

**COMP3130 2023 Mobile Application Development**
**Major Work Deliverable-1 (15%) Mobile Application Design**
**Due date:** Sunday, March 26, Week-5, 11.55 pm (Marked out of 100)

**The App:**
You must create a design for a mobile application using a tool of your choice. The theme is to create an app that is used for charity donations. A person must sign up to use the app. Once logged in, the viewer must be able to browse through different categories of various charities. Once a category is chosen, the viewer will be able to view the different charity organisations under that category. A viewer must be able to view more information about a particular charity organisation. When the viewer chooses to donate they could choose up to $1000 and have the option to be an anonymous donor. All payments go through a credit card form where the viewer enters their credit card information. Your design must also include credit card validation screens. A receipt is added to their account.

You are allowed to use as many screens as you think is necessary to display all the information.

**The tasks:**

1. **Task 1 (20 marks):** Storyboard of your app (this could be mini snapshots showing us the screen flow of the app). You can also submit a video here.

2. **Task 2 (30 marks):** Wireframes for every screen in the application.

3. **Task 3 (40 marks):** Mockups for every screen in the application. If the application is designed for iOS then the mock-up should reflect that.

4. **Task 4 (10 marks):** Describe the background reading/research you have carried out to design the app the way you have. Include the sources that have influenced your design. About 2 pages - 11 pt font, 1 line spacing.

**Submission Instructions:**
Please submit a single PDF. Title the tasks and the screens appropriately (think about it as a document for the client who has very little IT background). Use the Turnitin link provided underneath the folder to submit your assignment.
