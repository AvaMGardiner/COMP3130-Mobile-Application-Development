INSTRUCTIONS

I've been testing my application on my Oppo A53s device, which has a resolution of 3120 x 4160. While the app should work fine on any Android phone using the Android Emulator, I recommend testing it on your phone if you own an Android. In my experience, it looks better on the Expo app, as I have tested it on multiple phones at home compared to Android Emulator.
