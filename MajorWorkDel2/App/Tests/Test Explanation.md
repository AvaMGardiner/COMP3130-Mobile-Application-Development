TEST EXPLANATION

When it comes to testing applications, there are different techniques that developers can use to ensure that everything is functioning correctly. For starters, a unit test is a great way to test a system's most minor and isolated components to ensure everything works as it should. Another type of testing is integration testing, which involves testing different software modules together to ensure they work seamlessly. Finally, system testing involves testing the entire software product to ensure it meets the desired specifications and performs as expected.

Therefore, the provided tests in Authentication.test.js are unit tests rather than system or integration tests. They focus on testing individual units of code in isolation. They are designed to verify the behaviour and logic of each component individually and are not dependent on the presence or behaviour of other components or external dependencies. The tests use mocking libraries to replace external dependencies with mock implementations, allowing for isolated testing. In addition, they cover specific functionalities of the components, such as rendering, form submissions, navigation, and data display.
