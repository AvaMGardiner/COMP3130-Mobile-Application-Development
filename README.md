# COMP3130: Mobile Application Development

In this unit, I covered the design and development of mobile applications from both a technical and user experience perspective. I reviewed the underlying environments provided by mobile devices and evaluated the relative merits of different implementation technologies. I discussed the relationship between mobile applications and the web, as well as the requirements for providing an effective user experience for offline and intermittently connected devices. The unit also included coverage of the design of the user experience for mobile applications, and I developed my ability to critically evaluate the usability of a mobile design.
