# COMP3130: Mobile Application Development

**Overview**

In this unit, I covered the design and development of mobile applications from both a technical and user experience perspective. I reviewed the underlying environments provided by mobile devices and evaluated the relative merits of different implementation technologies. I discussed the relationship between mobile applications and the web, as well as the requirements for providing an effective user experience for offline and intermittently connected devices. The unit also included coverage of the design of the user experience for mobile applications, and I developed my ability to critically evaluate the usability of a mobile design.

**Technology Used**

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [React-Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native)

- **Major Work Deliverable-I: Mobile Application Design**

In my Major Work Deliverable-I, which focused on Mobile Application Design, I was tasked with crafting both medium and high-fidelity designs for an app. Implementation of the designs was not required, so there were no constraints on creativity. The app’s theme was centered around facilitating charity donations.   

- **Major Work Deliverable-II: Design and Development of a Mobile Application**

In my Major Work Deliverable-II, I designed and developed a mobile app using Expo/React-Native. The app, centered around recording charity information, allows users to manage their charity collections. The project was open-ended, encouraging exploration beyond classroom teachings. I had the freedom to adjust the app’s structure and content as needed. This project evaluated my skills in design, implementation, testing, and deployment of a mobile application.
